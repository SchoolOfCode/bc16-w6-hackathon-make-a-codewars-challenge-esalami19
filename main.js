/*clinical trial drug A and drug B
drug A is the real one drug B is the placebo.
we need a function that evenly distributes drug A and B to an array of objects containing different people and their medical information.
example of array:
plan:
DONE step 1 - download packages 
DONE step 2 - make sure test files are set up with import and export links
DONE step 3 - set up export shell for function
DONE step 4 - decide on story that will use logic and conditions 
step 5 - decide specific pieces of logic for each paitent
step 6 - flesh out parts of code like array for test
step 7 - create test that will take array and output array with new assigned drug for each patient and array in string?
step 8 - create function that will pass first test
step 9 write two other boundary specific tests
step 10 - write out markdown file
