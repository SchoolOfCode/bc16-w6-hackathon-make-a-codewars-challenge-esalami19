# Clinical Trials

clinical trial drug A and drug B
drug A is for people with allergies and drug b for people with no allergies
you must assign the right person to the right drug and return the drug that has been assigned to them

```javascript
Example code:
function clinicalTrial(patient){

}

```

plan:

- step 1 - download packages
- step 2 - make sure test files are set up with import and export links
- step 3 - set up export shell for function
- step 4 - decide on story that will use logic and conditions
- step 5 - decide specific pieces of logic for each paitent
- step 6 - flesh out test data that will be linked to logic
  step 7 - create test that will take array and output array with new assigned drug for each patient and array in string?
  step 8 - create function that will pass first test
  step 9 write two other boundary specific tests
  step 10 - write out markdown file
